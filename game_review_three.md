I'd rate this game a solid 4

Summary
The game is very basic, with only a few buttons as the control scheme, that being the left and right mouse button. Left mouse interacts with UI and the right pauses the games
timeflow. You are the watcher over a lone hero as they roam about the map; the catch is that the map is a set loop that is'nt generally all that big. You're hero will go
run the loop as many times as you want encountering enemies and certain situations, however once again there's a catch. You set the map up yourself for your hero to run through.
After a certain amount of loops, your hero will fight a boss, one you'd rather be prepared for unless you want your hero to suffer an untimely death. 
The world has been wiped out by an unknown lich, save for a loop and your hero. It seems however that every time the hero loops and kills certain enemies, they remember more
and more of their world which in turn gives you more to build the world around them with. At the end of each loop though, the world is reset and you begin again with new tiles
to place down, each with their own reward and punishment. More enemies mean more exp and more treasure, with the added downside of a punishing run for your hero. After each run
there is a home world you can build up as well as a sort of camp for you and any other lost souls you can scrounge up.

Final Thoughts
Whilst I think that the game loop doesn't hook me for a long amount of time, the game has undeniable replayability and a great theme to it. The music is wonderful and the 
graphics are well done pixel art. The gameplay itself is fun but I find management games of this caliber to be a little less fun than building a thriving city or something of
that nature. Be that as it may, I can't deny that the game is fun and a nice casual experience to play for a quick break from school or work.S
