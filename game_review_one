On a scale from 1 to 10 for this particular game I would rate it a 8 out of 10. 

Combat

Like a Dragon is the 8th game in the yakuza series. Right out of the gate I'd like to talk about the departure of the combat style from the previous games in the series.
Yakuza is a series that started with a real time action combat style, as well as classic rpg mechanics mixed in. This included training combos, furthering said combo strings,
damage, health, overall speed, and many special moves falling under the classic Heat system which was essentially a special move bar. 
For Like a Dragon however, all those systems go out the window. The game takes on a classic turn-based rpg style in order to freshen up the combat system.
While this may or may not be welcome to long time fans of the bombastic combat and intense boss fights which flowed seamlessly together,
it certainly does change the flow and make the yakuza series nigh unrecognizable from the combat alone. While I personally liked the combat, looking back
I find that it does lack certain aspects which would've raised it higher in my rating for it and that is the classic skill point investments you were able to make
in previous games. I personally love that system as it allowed for a more randomized character build for earlier scenarios of the game until later when
you would of course be maxed out level wise. This also gave a much higher sense of accomplishment, as the achievement of getting a new skill was to be highly anticipated
especially once you had a specific one in sight. The new system makes it so that all Stat control you have personally is through gear equipped to your character.
While I'm not opposed to that idea, I found the loss of the original character development to leave a bit of a hole in combat. Having said all that,
let me get into the importance of this system and how it plays into the overall story as well as being implemented in the first place.

Story

The story of Like a Dragon is wonderfully told with intense and passionate voice acting from all characters involved.
The yakuza series is famed for its long, complex stories and Like a Dragon doubled down in both ends. Countless twists and heart-rending moments permeate this story
and will stick with me for a long while. To give a quick idea of the game and why the combat has taken such a turn, allow me to give you a fast introduction
to our main character, Ichiban Kasuga. Ichiban is an up and coming member of the Arakawa family well respected within it. Arakawa himself is a father figure to
Ichiban and essentially adopted him into the family. As a kid he always played the Dragon Quest games and was a huge fan of them. As a result, Ichiban dreams of being
a bonafide hero. This is how it comes about that he chooses to fight the way he does, albeit a silly connection to the events of the game, his friend recognizes
that he fights in a way that let’s his enemies get a turn in. I think it’s a clever way to excuse the change in combat style especially since the
main character will be at the helm of the Yakuza series going forward. Ichiban’s family quickly starts to spiral as someone gets in big trouble and being the hero he is,
Ichiban takes the blame. This leads to an incredible amount of events that miraculously form a massive story which will encapsulate you.
The rest of the aspects of the game like music and level design is impressive as well.

Music

The music in Like a Dragon is well made, it pulls you into each fight and each dungeon you explore feels more hollow and dank with the atmosphere
a firm focus in the developers eyes. The music isn’t an especially amazing piece of this game however, it simply does a good job in the areas it’s used.

Graphics

The graphics are some of the best yet, and because of this the game feels so alive when you walk down one of the 3 main city streets you have access to.
The night life is so vibrant and the day time is blissfully beautiful. The game really highlights the character models which helps immersion in the story,
the characters facial animations, body language, and style is all what makes the characters in the game really pop. The game is vibrant and flashy and without
the proper graphic design behind it, the game could’ve easily been a flop with the large amount of cheesiness put into the combat and minigames.

For my final thoughts on the game, I think it’s an amazing jump off point for the beginning of a new era in Yakuza. The combat was great,
the amount of classes you could choose and the variety within each one is nice too. I think the graphics were amazing as well, every cutscene is excellently
done and even the minigames have lots to offer in terms of good looking art and fun little animations. Speaking of minigames, they were all a blast.
The mario kart-esque game dragon kart, the Ichiban business management game, the movie viewing game, the trivia school, and of course the karaoke bar,
a staple in each Yakuza game. Overall, the game is fantastic and definitely deserves a play, and could even be a good spot to start in the Yakuza series for
newcomers too if you don’t want to play the previous games.
