Question: During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.

Answer: The rules were very clear, the game is frought with tutorials.

Question: During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?

Answer: There's plenty of visual easter eggs that wouldn't affect the game if they were out but those don't affect much if left in either. Besides that, the game is very 
well polished.

Question: Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?

Answer: The game is certainly balanced for people who have a better handle on first person games, as the controls are numerous and have plenty of combat applications
that you'll have to ingrain in your memory.

Question: Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?

Answer: The rythym of the game is super fast paced and is insane for newcomers. Once accustomed to the controls however, the games combat becomes a dance of death at a certain
point since you'll have encountered many enemies after a certain time.

Question: During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?

Answer: The theme of the game went superbly with the gameplay, the over the top action and great level design as well as world design makes the game a fantastic play
especially the music which is one of my favorite aspects of the game.

Question: Did you have fun playing this game?

Answer: I had a lot of fun playing this game, the gameplay is so well designed you could play forever and have a million different ways to set up each encounter, and even 
more to maximize efficiency in clearing levels.

Question: During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?

Answer: Every now and again invisible walls would plague the game and impede progression as well as some iffy hitboxes but besides that there's not much else about it 
that goes wrong.
