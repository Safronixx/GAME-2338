Summary
  Persona 5 is a capstone game for the series in terms of introducing it to a larger spectrum for enjoyment, with the release on the ps4 being a huge part of it. Because of this,
the publicity for it was widespread and it more than lives up to the hype. The graphics are amazing, classic anime but with fresh crisp visuals and plenty of attention to detail.
The backgrounds are flashy, animations are bombastic, and characters are well detailed, not to mention bosses and enemies to boot. The game's graphics help establish it in the
action genre and surprisingly lends itself to a laidback game when not fighting monsters. This is in part thanks to the music which I believe to be a masterpiece through and 
through.
  Persona's music has been a staple of the series and Persona 5 is quite possibly one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. from fantastic atmosphere and ambience design, to
normal enemy encounters and dungeon crawling music, to the epic and massive boss battles with too much riding on them, the music will have you bobbing your head all the while.
Normally a game will have one, two, maybe 3 favorite songs from them, but each song from Persona 5 is favorite material, with every song bursting with diversity and individuality.
Of course it's important to mention that the fight sequences are only ramped up and make for a fantastic equal to the great gameplay given by Persona to us.
  The gameplay is wonderfully crafted, with the pokemone style persona gathering, and the dungeon aspects to gain more gear, the game's got legs for miles. It is worth mentioning
however, that the grind is prevalent in this game and it's an unfortunate aspect that plagues most rpgs. Persona 5 does eventually grant an ability to grease the wheels though,
with an ability that lets you instantly kill enemies if they're low enough level. This is a game changer once you aquire it and helps with the grind for the most part. One major
aspect of the game is relationships as well, which helps immerse you in the world by befriending your group and in turn making the characters combat skills better.
  
Final Thoughts
In summation, Persona 5 is an excellent game, with 100's of hours worth of gameplay and story to offer. The game even has a remastered version available as well, with even more
content for the main game. I loved this game's gameplay and music immensely, I still listen to the soundtrack most everyday in fact! I highly recommend trying this game and 
seeing how the story comes about and how the lovable cast of characters comes together to defeat an ultimate evil that is still relevant today.
