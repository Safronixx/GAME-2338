## Summary

This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarizing the
game play mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what,
when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

  Awesomenauts is a basic moba based in space. The graphics and art direction are somewhat childlike but at the same time are well put together and create an experience
that allows for players to easily follow whats happening. The game is challenging, and difficult for new players with strategies, ambush tactics and certain gameplay elements
but is fairly basic for a moba to follow. You would easily be able to ascertain the goal of each game with clear instructions and popups that help guide the player. 
Awesomenauts is a 3v3 game and focuses on communication and teamwork, as this will be vital to fighting the enemy in both offense and defense.

  Awesomenauts graphic design is simplistic and nice to look at, while not being beautiful, the moba genre never has been known for graphic fidelity specifically. The simple
 graphics do lend to easy to follow combat however, and lets the important elements have the spotlight as opposed to a big jumbled mess on screen. As mentioned before, the
 game does have slightly more childish art direction when compared to games like Smite or League of Legends but it gives it something unique to stand on. Character design 
 is incredibly diverse and means each character has a huge pull to playing as them. I love the differences between all the characters, they even have their own soundtracks 
 permeating the gameplay.
  
  The gameplay is very fun and intuitive, easy to learn but hard to master. With teamwork in this game however, the toughest of enemies can be brought down even by a team of
 slightly well coordinated noobs. The abilites of each character are very fleshed out, and make each character a game changer when it comes to divising strategies to overcome
 them. I also really appreciate that the characters ultimate abilities are well balanced, so many mobas have way overpowered abilities and it's refreshing to know that 
 a player for the most part can't kill you in a second when you're caught out alone.

## Final Thoughts

Describe in as much detail as possible what you did and didn't enjoy about the
game and list out your reasons why. Remember this is a review and thus should
stand up to some criticism when making your reasons why you thought this way
about particular features of the game. This should be at a minimum of 1
paragraph.

  Awesomenauts is a very fun moba game that has a cartoonish 2d style that works well for its reasons. The games design is all very well combined together and helps new
 players and seasoned players alike. I think Awesomenauts is a fantastic moba game that is more casual then a lot of other options with a more friendly community, a more
 approachable design, and at some points to its detriment, its limited gametype options. Overall, it is a fun moba that can satisfy a player looking for a quick fun game to 
 play but may not be ultimately sustainable for more serious players of the moba genre.
