Summary

  Deep Rock Galactic is a game filled with great gameplay, graphics, and cooperative fun. Lets start with the gameplay as a talking point. Deep Rock Galactic is essentially an 
operation based shooter, each mission with a few goals and with a finale getaway sequence. The game also boasts a intuitive RPG leveling system for both the characters and
the weapons they use, letting a lot more customability and decision making be possible for which direction to take your characters.The fun with it is based in the navigation 
of the world.
  You're deep underground and the caves you dwell are inhabited by all manner of creatures you'll have to face. That being said, the way you can handle these
monsters varies by which class you pick. For instance, the gunner could handle the majority of creatures by themselves, whereas the scout or driller may be hard pressed to 
handle large clusters of creatures at once. Of course each class has their ups and downs when it comes to particular aspects of the game, the driller can get around the caves
via digging, the scout has a grappling hookand better mobility over all, and the engineer and gunner have much more limited routes overall, both the latter more suited to excel
in combat situations. The balance of which lends itself to its second great aspect, the cooperative gameplay.
  While you are able to play the game solo to great effect, the games best aspects come out in team work, the unity of all classes working together to fight and accomplish 
goals. The game is easy to play with random people online as well as friends making sure that the gameplay isn't
hindered by a lack of matchmaking options. With clear and easy goals to get to as well as an unending amount of monsters to deal with, your team will be brought together whether
they mean to or not. The final main factor of the games is the graphics.
  The graphics are simply amazing, with the over the top effects, the well implemented lighting, the shadows of creatures around the corner and the mysticism of each new cave
system make exploration a want rather than a necessity. It's fantastical world with fun gameplay and beautiful caves truly make this game a star when it comes to cooperative
mission based gaming, on par with the likes of Warhammer: Vermintide, and Payday, and Earth Defense Force, and even those cant brag about having graphics anywhere close to the
uniqueness brought forth here.

Final Thoughts

I find that this game excels in providing a spot between casual and dedicated mission based games like those mentioned before with upwards to 30 or 40 minute missions as opposed
to the more fast paced variants that Deep Rock Galactic provide. It's easy to play a quick game of and fun too, with a still fairly active community and a fun leveling system 
that is immediately accessible and rewards the player with precisely the upgrades they want to see for the weapons they have.
